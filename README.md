This repository contains the Python source code for the simulation of power and energy demand of an electric vehicles 
(EV) during its drive cycle. This simulation takes in various vehicle parameter as its inputs. The simulation uses the
methods describes by Gillespie<sup>1</sup> and Plett<sup>2</sup>.
